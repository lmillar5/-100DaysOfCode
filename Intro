My principle aim for the #100DaysOfCode challenge is to enhance my core JavaScript and PHP skills. 
My knowledge is currently above basic and I can read and understand the majority of the code; however I am yet to write from scratch my own program
Due to GDPR and company policy in the place where I work; I may not be able to share the code that I am working on, however I will keep a daily diary of my progress.
